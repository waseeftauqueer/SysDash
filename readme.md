### **SysDash: A Customizable System Dashboard** 🖥️

**SysDash** is a script written in Bash that provides a real-time system dashboard on your terminal. It displays various system information like load average, memory usage, disk usage, network monitoring, and running processes.

#### **Features**
- **Easy to use**: No complex configuration required. Just run the script and get a comprehensive system overview. 🚀
- **Customization**: The `custom_dashboard` function allows you to add your own information to the display. ✨
- **Real-time updates**: SysDash refreshes the information periodically (default: 5 seconds) for a dynamic view of your system's health. 🔄
- **Supports multiple package managers**: Automatically detects and uses `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf`, or `brew` for installing `ifstat` (if not already present). ⚙️

#### **Requirements**
- **Bash shell**
- **ifstat utility** (SysDash will attempt to install it if missing)

#### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository or download the script (`sysdash.sh`).
2. Make the script executable: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x sysdash.sh
   ```
3. Run the script: 
   ```bash
   ./sysdash.sh
   ```

#### **Usage**
- The script will continuously update system information on your terminal. Press **Ctrl+C** to exit. ⏹️
